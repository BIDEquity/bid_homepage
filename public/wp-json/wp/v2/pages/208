Newsletter<\/h2>\n<h3>MailChimp<\/h3>\n<p>This website uses the services of MailChimp to send out its newsletters. The provider is the Rocket Science Group LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE, Suite 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA.<\/p>\n<p>Among other things, MailChimp is a service that can be deployed to organise and analyse the sending of newsletters. Whenever you enter data for the purpose of subscribing to a newsletter (e.g. your e-mail address), the information is stored on MailChimp servers in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>MailChimp is in possession of a certification that is in compliance with the \u201eEU-US-Privacy-Shield.\u201c The \u201ePrivacy-Shield\u201c is a compact between the European Union (EU) and the United States of America (USA) that aims to warrant the compliance with European data protection standards in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>With the assistance of the MailChimp tool, we can analyse the performance of our newsletter campaigns. If you open an e-mail that has been sent through the MailChimp tool, a file that has been integrated into the e-mail (a so-called web-beacon) connects to MailChimp\u2019s servers in the United States. As a result, it can be determined whether a newsletter message has been opened and which links the recipient possibly clicked on. Technical information is also recorded at that time (e.g. the time of access, the IP address, type of browser and operating system). This information cannot be allocated to the respective newsletter recipient. Their sole purpose is the performance of statistical analyses of newsletter campaigns. The results of such analyses can be used to tailor future newsletters to the interests of their recipients more effectively.<\/p>\n<p>If you do not want to permit an analysis by MailChimp, you must unsubscribe from the newsletter. We provide a link for you to do this in every newsletter message. Moreover, you can also unsubscribe from the newsletter right on the website.<\/p>\n<p>The data is processed based on your consent (Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. a GDPR). \u00a0You may revoke any consent you have given at any time by unsubscribing from the newsletter. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any data processing transactions that have taken place prior to your revocation.<\/p>\n<p>The data deposited with us for the purpose of subscribing to the newsletter will be stored by us until you unsubscribe from the newsletter or the newsletter service provider and deleted from the newsletter distribution list after you unsubscribe from the newsletter. Data stored for other purposes with us remain unaffected.<\/p>\n<p>After you unsubscribe from the newsletter distribution list, your e-mail address may be stored by us or the newsletter service provider in a blacklist to prevent future mailings. The data from the blacklist is used only for this purpose and not merged with other data. This serves both your interest and our interest in complying with the legal requirements when sending newsletters (legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR). The storage in the blacklist is indefinite. <strong>You may object to the storage if your interests outweigh our legitimate interest.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For more details, please consult the Data Privacy Policies of MailChimp at: <a href=\"https:\/\/mailchimp.com\/legal\/terms\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/mailchimp.com\/legal\/terms\/<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Execution of a contract data processing agreement<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We have executed a so-called \u201eData Processing Agreement\u201c with MailChimp, in which we mandate that MailChimp undertakes to protect the data of our customers and to refrain from sharing it with third parties.<\/p>\n<h2>7.

The provider is Google Ireland Limited (\u201eGoogle\u201c), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.<\/p>\n<p>To enable the use of the Google Maps features, your IP address must be stored. As a rule, this information is transferred to one of Google\u2019s servers in the United States, where it is archived.

Below, we will brief you on the scope, purpose and use of the personal data collected from you in conjunction with the application process. We assure you that the collection, processing and use of your data will occur in compliance with the applicable data privacy rights and all other statutory provisions and that your data will always be treated as strictly confidential.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Scope and purpose of the collection of data<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you submit a job application to us, we will process any affiliated personal data (e.g. contact and communications data, application documents, notes taken during job interviews, etc.), if they are required to make a decision concerning the establishment or an employment relationship.

Afterwards the data will be deleted, and the physical application documents will be destroyed. The storage serves in particular as evidence in the event of a legal dispute. If it is evident that the data will be required after the expiry of the 6-month period (e.g. due to an impending or pending legal dispute), deletion will only take place when the purpose for further storage no longer applies.<\/p>\n<p>Longer storage may also take place if you have given your agreement (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR) or if statutory data retention requirements preclude the deletion.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Admission to the applicant pool<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If we do not make you a job offer, you may be able to join our applicant pool. In case of admission, all documents and information from the application will be transferred to the applicant pool in order to contact you in case of suitable vacancies.<\/p>\n<p>Admission to the applicant pool is based exclusively on your express agreement (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). The submission agreement is voluntary and has no relation to the ongoing application procedure. <strong>The affected person can revoke his agreement at any time.
